

X, Y, and Z Images should be relative (and fluid)
to the background-image labeled "graph" regardless of size.

However when I apply transition using media query
they are only aligned at each specific query point 
ie. 992-768-668- etc. Resizing results in non-alignment
so to speak. I am in need to have X, Y and Z images
to maintain alignment/transition regardless of viewport
size.

Is this possible?

(I attempted for weeks 
to draw the lines with css but could not get the diagonal 
line "Z" to stay adjoined with the lower right corner when 
resizing- I settled for a photoshop version background to make 
the three line segments maintain visual appearance.)

I am self taught in html/css and requesting help from a professional/
formally educated developer.

Thank you,
Sway
