When the page loads I have mutliple images that transition from off screen -
to on screen - and finally off screen, on three different axis Y, X, and Z.

Y, X, and Z Images should be relative (and fluid)
to the background-image container labeled "graph" regardless 
of size or viewport width.

However, when I apply transition using media query
the (Y, X and Z imgs) are only aligned at each specific query point 
ie. 992-768-668- etc. Resizing results in non-alignment
so to speak. I am in need to have Y, X and Z images
to maintain alignment/transition regardless of size 
or viewport width.

Is this possible? Im sure it is but need guidance.

*background-color changes with each media query size only for 
my reference, (like "training wheels") its easier for me to 
visually understand "where" everything is based on screen size.
When complete, the background color will be black regardless
of screen size.

I am self taught in html/css and requesting help from a professional/
formally educated developer.

Thank you,
