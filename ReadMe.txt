When the page loads I have mutliple images that transition from off screen
to on screen and off screen on three different axis  Y X and Z.

X, Y, and Z Images should be relative (and fluid)
to the background-image container labeled "graph" regardless of size.

However, when I apply transition using media query
the (X, Y and Z imgs) are only aligned at each specific query point 
ie. 992-768-668- etc. Resizing results in non-alignment
so to speak. I am in need to have X, Y and Z images
to maintain alignment/transition regardless of viewport
size.

Is this possible? Im sure it is but need guidance.

*background-color changes with each media query size only for 
reference- like "training wheels" its easier for me to 
visually understand "where" everything is based on screen size.
When complete, the background color will be black regardless
of screen size.

(I attempted for weeks 
to draw the lines with css but could not get the diagonal 
line "Z" to stay adjoined with the lower right corner when 
resizing- I settled for a photoshop version background to make 
the three line segments maintain visual appearance.)

I am self taught in html/css and requesting help from a professional/
formally educated developer.

Thank you,
